                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p> Hello, I am Steven Langlois. I am orginally from Wisconsin but after graduating from the University
                    of Wisconsin-Stout I moved to Minnesota for better carreer opportunities. I am currently employed
                    with Wells Fargo at the moment
                    but I am hoping with the expereince working in a coding bootcamp to further my career.

                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>
                    My family is from Altoona, WI. My father is currently retired and my mother is a teacher in Altoona.
                    My brother is currently going to school at UW-Eau Claire for a computer science major.
                    We also have a dog named dexter, who likes to run around and play fetch.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    My hobbies included watching sporting events whether is be on TV or in person. I have been to many
                    Milwaukee Brewer baseball games and one Minnesota Twin game. I am a Brewer fan but I enjoy watching
                    both teams.
                    I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows. My favorite movie is "The Goonies" and my favorite TV
                    show is "Breaking Bad".

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>
                    My plans for the future include completing my coding bootcamp that I am currently apart of and
                    potentially find a full stack developer position. I am hoping to learn much more real world
                    applications and to learn from peers at the job place.
                    I am hoping to grow my portfolio with these experiences and look forward to any knew challenges that
                    might arise within the future.
